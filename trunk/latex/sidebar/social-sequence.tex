\begin{sidebox}{The Sequence}
The Caller establishes the order characters will act in, then iterates over the following sequence, one character at a time:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Declare an action (and potentially a target).
\item \Compels{} from the table.
\item Free move (optional).
\item Roll \dplusskill{}.
\item Apply \Aspects{} and spin (player and table).
\item Action resolution and narration.
\end{enumerate}

When all players have had a turn, check timer box and determine whether victory conditions are met.
\end{sidebox}
