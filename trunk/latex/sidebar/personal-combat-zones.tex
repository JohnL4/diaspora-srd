\begin{sidebox}{Map Design: Zones}

Some heuristics for zones inside structures include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Rooms with doors that close are a zone, no matter how small.
\item Split big zones up simply because the range is long (if the space is big enough to swing a broadsword).
\item Overall, try to keep the basic rules for zone ranges: same zone is punching, adjacent zone is poking, two zones away is throwing, three or more is shooting. Four zones is enough to credibly claim you can escape.
\end{itemize}
