\begin{sidebox}{Military Organization}

Organizational units vary from army to army, and from world to world, but it might help to think in terms of the following:

\begin{description}
\item [A team] is composed of 2-5 soldiers of a single vehicle. This is the basic unit of platoon-scale combat, and is represented on the map by a single figure.

\item [A squad] is composed of 1-3 teams and is commanded by a Sergeant or a Corporal.

\item [A platoon] is composed of 2-6 teams, commanded by a Lieutenant.

\item [A company] is composed of 3-5 platoons, under the command of a Captain. This is the largest unit to be controlled by a single player.

\item [A battalion] is composed of 2-6 companies, under the command of a Lieutenant Colonel. An engagement of two battalions is at the extreme upper end of the size of what can be modeled in Platoon-scale combat in Diaspora.
