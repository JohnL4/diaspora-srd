\subsection{Leadership}
\label{sec:Leadership}

Each platoon has one, and only one, leader unit. An infantry, armour, or artillery unit can be designated a leader.

A leader unit may perform a  action in addition to its normal action. It may, therefore, make two  actions in a turn.

Leaders have one Stunt chosen from the leadership Stunts list in addition to the Stunts for their base unit type.

Leaders add two morale boxes to the unit to which they are attached. The maximum movement for leader units is their base unit's maximum movement. Leader units contribute one extra fate point to the platoon (one for the leader and one for the base unit).

Leader units have two Aspects --- one for the leader and one for the base unit --- in addition to \aspect{Out of ammo}.
