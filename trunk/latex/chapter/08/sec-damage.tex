\section{Damage}\label{sec:platoon-combat-damage}

When playing a fast game with many units, any hit past the end of a track removes the unit (it is just Taken Out). Prior to determining the Taken Out result, hits may be mitigated with platoon Consequences. A platoon can have a maximum of three Consequences, exactly as player characters and spacecraft: one mild, which can reduce incoming shifts by one; one medium, which can reduce incoming shifts by two; and one severe, which can reduce incoming shifts by four. Platoon Consequences are also Aspects that are effectively on all units of the platoon. They may be free-tagged once.
