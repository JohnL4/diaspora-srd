\subsection{Skills}
\label{sec:platoon-combat-skills}

All Skills are eligible to be chosen by any unit type. See \autoref{tab:platoon-unit-skills} for a list of the unit skills available.

\input{tables/platoon-unit-skills}

Units may only roll Skills for which they are trained. The only
exception is when defending against an opposed roll, in which case the
untrained Skill is presumed to be zero. The only case presented here
is Armour, though with an appropriate Stunt  Camouflage may also
qualify.
