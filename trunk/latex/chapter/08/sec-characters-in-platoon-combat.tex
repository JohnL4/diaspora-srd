\section{Characters in Platoon Combat}\label{sec:characters-in-platoon-combat}

A character may be associated with any unit. While more than one character can be associated with a single unit, for playability it helps to assign characters to different units, to allow players something to control during the game. A single character stand can have his base touching the associated unit base for representation, but it is easier just to note which character is associated with which unit separately. The player character moves with the unit. If the unit is destroyed, the player character is no longer involved in the combat (he's gone to ground, run off, or dead --- let the player narrate his escape).

Each character associated with a unit may, however, amplify one Skill of the unit. The player may choose which Skill gets amplified based on \autoref{tab:amplifying-platoon-skills}.
