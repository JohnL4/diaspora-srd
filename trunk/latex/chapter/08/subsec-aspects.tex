\subsection{Aspects}
\label{sec:platoon-unit-aspects}

All units have one descriptive Aspect chosen by the owner and add one fate point to their platoon. All units also have the Aspect \aspect{Out of ammo}. A unit, when spending fate points, expends platoon fate points. When a unit gains a fate point through a compel, that fate point belongs to the platoon.
