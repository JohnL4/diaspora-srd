Armour has a 4-cap Skill column. Armour units have one Skill at rank 4, one at rank 3, one at rank 2, and one at rank 1. They have a Morale track one box long. If the unit has Veteran Skill 1 or 2, the Morale track is two boxes long. If the unit has Veteran Skill of 3 or 4, the Morale track is three boxes long.

The maximum movement for armour is four zones. Armour units may move a maximum of four zones regardless of their movement roll result.
