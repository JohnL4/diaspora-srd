\section{Linking Systems}\label{sec:linking-systems} % \href{sec:id72}

In Diaspora, systems are separated by unknown volumes of space --- their positions in the universe are so diverse as to be likely unknown and possibly unknowable. And yet they are connected into a tight cluster of only a few stars by some currently inexplicable laws of physics. These connections, the slipstreams, take only an instant to traverse, but in that instant vast quantities of heat accumulate and must be dissipated upon arrival.

\index{slipknot}
Slipstream points (slipknots) are located at a distance roughly 5 AU (astronomical units) above and below the barycenter, which is the point around which all bodies in the system revolve. How close you need to be to this point is determined by the technology level of your slip system --- a small device, but capable of translating the ship across unknown distances pre-determined by hidden geometries of our universe.

You can re-use your clusters as often as you like --- there is room in any one of them for more than one campaign --- but they are small enough that it's simple to build a new one every time you make characters if you prefer.
