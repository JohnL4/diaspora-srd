\chapter{Characters}\label{sec:characters} % \href{sec:id75}

Creating a character uses a process that creates significant interaction in each others' backgrounds. No Diaspora game begins, ``You all meet in a space bar'' --- how all the characters know each other and even what dirty secrets they share will all be considered as part of character creation. By this stage you may already have selected a referee from your group to run the game. That's cool and natural. Resist, however, the temptation for the referee to not make a character. There are several rewards to the inclusion of the referee in this process.

First, when there are more than three characters being created there are characters who do not necessarily know each other except as a ``friend of a friend'' and this is cool.

Second, and perhaps more importantly, it creates the opportunity for players to change roles as the campaign progresses --- if a player has a story in mind and an urge to referee a game to trigger it, it's a great deal of fun if the prior referee can grab his character and join a new game in a familiar story line.
