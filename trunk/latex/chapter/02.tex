\chapter{Clusters}
\label{sec:clusters}

The first session of a Diaspora campaign is used to create the setting and the characters. At the time of this first session it is not necessary to have a referee (what some games call the Game Master or GM).  Everyone can have complete narrative authority over the pieces they will create.

Designate someone as caller. This person will guide the group through the application of the rules and perhaps take notes on the results, even though the caller's creative input need not be any greater than that of any other player.

You will create a handful of systems and find out what they are like, filling in details with your own stories as you make sense of the system statistics.

You will then link these systems into a structure called the clus\-ter, which will show which systems are connected to each other by slipstreams. Faster-than-light travel between stars only occurs along these paths. Once this geometry is established, it can be useful to return to the systems and write a little more: how do various surpluses and deficiencies affect slipstream traffic? Who supplies slip ships? Who com\-petes?
