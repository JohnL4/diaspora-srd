\subsection{Brawling and Close Combat Weapons}
\label{sec:brawling-and-close-combat-weapons}

Brawling and Close Combat weapons are blades, clubs, and other designed melee weapons. They also include thrown weapons such as spears, shuriken, and (at higher technologies) grenades.

\subsubsection{Build Points}

There is less variety between tech levels than with other objects in this game. The number of available build points is determined by the Tech level at which the weapon first becomes available, as shown on \autoref{tab:bp-per-tech-level}. The costs of improving the statistics of a weapon are shown in \autoref{tab:brawling-close-combat-statistics}, and the weapon stunts available (and their bp costs) may be found in \autoref{tab:weapon-stunt-costs}

All Brawling weapons are Civilian, so do not require a Military-grade stunt to use. They may, however, be constrained by cultural familiarity.

\subsubsection{Cost}

If a player wishes his character to own such a weapon at the start of a game, it should simply be granted. There is no obvious reason to differentiate or restrict them as thematic restriction comes out of law levels anyway. The base cost for \skill{Brawling} and \skill{Close Combat} weapons is 1 except for found weapons, which are free.
