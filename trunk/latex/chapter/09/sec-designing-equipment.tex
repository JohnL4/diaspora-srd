\section{Designing Equipment}\label{sec:Designing Equipment} % \href{sec:id217}

The core design process for equipment is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Establish the number of build points (bp) as a function of technology rating.
\item Establish the statistics that can be modified by bp.
\item Establish the cost of increasing or decreasing each Statistic.
\item List Stunts that affect the function of the system under design with their
costs.
\item List Aspects that derive from the choices made.
\item Establish a function that derives the Cost from the above.
\end{itemize}

We have constructed several design sequences in this framework for you but you
could easily extend this framework to construct your own design sequences.
