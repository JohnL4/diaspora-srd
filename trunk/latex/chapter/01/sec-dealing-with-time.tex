When you want an action to succeed but have the degree of success (or failure) determine how long it took, the referee should set the difficulty and the base time needed to resolve (picked from the Time Track in \autoref{tab:the-time-track}). Each shift generated moves up the track one line. Negative shifts move down the track one line for each shift.

Some tasks might fail altogether with negative shifts, but potentially go faster with greater success.

The referee can decide that a task cannot fail if the character takes all the time in the world to finish it. In that case, negative shift does not signify failure but additional time needed, by moving down from the base time set according to the rolled result.
