\section{Damage}\label{sec:social-combat-damage}

Stress box hits are not real damage, but they can lead to Consequences. All stress box hits are removed after a few days of relaxing stress-free downtime. As with personal combat, the table should rule when enough time has passed or whether the downtime was sufficiently relaxing. Generally speaking it should be trivial.

\subsection{Recovering Consequences}\label{sec:social-combat-recovering-consequences}

A mild Consequence can be self-medicated with a bottle and some time alone once the scene is over. No roll is required and it is cleared as soon as the social combat scene is over.

A moderate Consequence remains until the end of the session in which it was incurred.

A severe Consequence must be carried through one complete session in which the associated stress track is never marked. If it is incurred during session one, it is gone no sooner than the end of session two, and if the associated stress track takes hit in a fight during that session, you'll need to hold the Consequence through yet another one.
