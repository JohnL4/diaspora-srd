\begin{sidebox}{Purchasing Spacecraft}

If a character does not start with a ship as a Stunt, they may choose to pay for one. This may represent outright ownership or an extended lease. Initial ship cost (separate from regular payments) is 8, modified as follows: -2 if the ship has the \emph{Civilian} Stunt; -1 if it has the \emph{Cheap} Stunt.

Cost is finally modified by the difference between the ship technology and the system technology where it is being purchased.
