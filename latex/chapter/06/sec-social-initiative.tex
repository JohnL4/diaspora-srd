\label{sec:Social Initiative}

The space combat mini-game operates using a form of social initiative. While often it is possible for the caller to start with one player who wants to act first and to proceed simply around the table, the stalemate-inducing anxieties of the uncertain commitment of resources over time can be fun to play with --- it creates the eerie feel of submarine combat, reducing the information available as decisions get made. For each of phases 1-4, the decision to act first resides with the player who states that they act first, with the caller determining priority if more than one person speaks at a time (or the table if the caller is controlling one of the affected ships).

% \rulebox{Resources, once com\-mit\-ted, can only be in\-creased.}

Going first entails a commitment of resources, and responses to the initial action can be proportionate, using the information of how much the first player has committed.
Resources, once committed, can only be increased.
They are never decreased.

As each phase ticks by, players may hold back attacking to wait until they see if they are being attacked and by how many, or they may strike hard and fast, filling their Heat track and hoping for a quick kill (or escape!).
