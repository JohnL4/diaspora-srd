\section{Spacecraft}
\label{sec:spacecraft}

Spacecraft are the unit of scale in this mini-game, and not player characters. They have their own \Skills\ (\Vshift, \skill{Electronic Warfare}, \skill{Beams}, and \skill{Torpedoes}), \Stunts, \Aspects\ and stress tracks (\Frame, \Data\ and \Heat). The mini-game will involve rolling those \Skills to achieve results and marking damage against those stress tracks.

Spacecraft can mitigate stress hits with three \Consequences, just as characters do. You will find a list of ships at the end of the chapter, and later a method for creating your own.

Spacecraft not designated as \stunt{Civilian} can only be flown by characters with the \stunt{Military-grade Pilot} Stunt. Further, offensive use of the \skill{EW} ship Skill can only be done by characters with the \stunt{Military-grade EW} Stunt. Aspects listed are meant as suggestions: every ship has its own quirks and personality.
