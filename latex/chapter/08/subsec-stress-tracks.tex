\subsection{Stress Tracks}\label{sec:platoon-unit-stress-tracks}

All units have a single stress track, \Morale. A platoon may expend \Consequences to mitigate hits past the end of the track on a unit. A platoon has three \Consequences\ to allocate and each can mitigate two shifts. As is standard in FATE, a platoon \Consequence\ becomes an Aspect and may be free-tagged once or compelled or tagged normally to affect any unit in the platoon.

\begin{itemize}
\item Infantry units have a base \Morale\ stress track of two boxes.
\item Armour units have a base \Morale\ stress track of one box.
\item Artillery units have a base \Morale\ stress track of two boxes.
\item Aircraft units have a base \Morale\ stress track of one box.
\end{itemize}

Unit \Morale\ tracks are modified by the unit's \Veteran\ skill. Leader units also gain a bonus \Morale.

\begin{itemize}
\item Leader units increase the base \Morale\ stress track by two.
\item Units with Veteran 1 or Veteran 2 increase their \Morale\ stress track by one.
\item Units with Veteran 3 or Veteran 4 increase their Morale stress track by two.
\item Units with Veteran 5 or Veteran 6 increase their Morale stress track by three.
\item Some stunts may further alter the length of the Morale stress track.
\end{itemize}
