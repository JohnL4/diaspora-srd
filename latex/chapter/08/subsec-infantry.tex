Infantry units represented a small number of individuals of similar or concerted equipment: a unit typically represents 2-5 individuals, though it could be as many as 12. Specific weapons and armour per individual are not modelled except as they are represented in the Skill and Stunt list.

Infantry have a 3-cap Skill pyramid. Infantry units choose one Skill at rank 3, two Skills at rank 2, and three Skills at rank 1. They have a Morale track two boxes long. If the unit has Veteran at rank 1 or 2, the Morale track is three boxes long. If the unit has Veteran at rank 3, the Morale track is four boxes long.

The maximum movement for infantry is two zones. Infantry units may move a maximum of two zones regardless of their movement roll.
