\chapter{Playing with FATE}
\label{cha:playing-with-fate}

Diaspora is a role-playing game with a focus on hard(ish) science-fiction adventure. You build a universe, you build characters, and then you play with them in it.

Underpinning the game is the task resolution system described in this chapter.

\index{Spirit of the Century}
All conflicts in Diaspora are resolved using the FATE mechanics as elaborated in \emph{Spirit of the Century} and available from the System Reference Document for that game, available on the \href{http://bzr.mausdompteur.de/fate3/fate3.html}{Internet}.%
\footnote{ \texttt{http://bzr.mausdompteur.de/fate3/fate3.html} }

You roll your set of four fudge dice, which yields a result between -4 and +4, you add an appropriate skill, and then you compare against some difficulty level, which might be someone else's roll or might be a level imposed by the referee.

Diaspora is also a set of mini-games. Each of these use fate dice, Aspects, and other elements from the FATE system but the may have other distinctions.  These mini-games are:
