\subsection{Slug Throwers}
\label{sec:slug-throwers}

Once we reach slug throwing technology we have more credible
technology dependence. Build points for Slug Throwers use the following formula, which generates the numbers in \autoref{tab:bp-per-tech-level}: $bp = 6 + T$.

\subsubsection{Aspects}
\begin{description}
\item[Out of ammo]
automatic Aspect on anyone firing a slug thrower. Free
taggable after a Full Auto AoE attack.
\item[Concealed Weapon]
automatic Aspect on anyone with a weapon with minimum range 0.
\item[Cheap]
automatic on any weapon with the Stunt Cheap.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Cost}

Slug Throwers have a base cost of 3. The Civilian Stunt reduces a
weapon's cost by 1. Add the technology rating of the weapon and
subtract the technology rating of the system in which it is being
purchased. Thus a Civilian T3 rifle would cost 2 on a T3 world, but 4
on a T1 world. Cheap weapons have cost reduced by 1.
