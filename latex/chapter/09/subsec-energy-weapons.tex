\subsection{Energy Weapons}
\label{sec:energy-weapons}

Energy Weapons become feasible at higher technology levels than slug
throwers do, and become more effective. The equation for the number of build points $bp$ at tech level $T$ is:
energy weapons is:

\[ bp = 1 + 3T \]

\autoref{tab:bp-per-tech-level} lists bp per tech level, and \autoref{tab:energy-weapon-build-costs} shows the bp cost for each statistic.

\subsubsection{Cost}

Energy Weapons have a base cost of 4. The \stunt{Civilian} \Stunt\ reduces a weapon's cost by 1. Add the technology rating of the weapon and subtract the technology rating of the system in which it is being purchased. Thus a T3 Plasma Gun would cost 3 on a T3 world, but 5 on a T1 world.
