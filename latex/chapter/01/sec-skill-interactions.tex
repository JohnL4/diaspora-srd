\subsection{Skill interactions}\label{sec:skill-interactions} % \href{sec:id67}

Sometimes it makes sense to have two skills interact to form the basis of a
check.
\begin{description}
\item[Skill A is \emph{Limited by} Skill B]~

This indicates that Skill A is used for the check but at a level no
higher than Skill B.
\item[Skill A is \emph{Amplified by} Skill B]~

This indicates that Skill A is used for the check. If Skill B exceeds Skill
A, then an additional +1 is granted.
\end{description}
