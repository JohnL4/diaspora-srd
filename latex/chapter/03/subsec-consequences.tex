\subsection{Consequences}\label{sec:Consequences} % \href{sec:id79}

Any time you are taking hits to a stress track, you can reduce the number of hits with Consequences. A mild Consequence reduces the incoming hits (usually shifts) by one, a moderate Consequence reduces them by two, and a severe Consequence reduces by four. Normally you can have at most three Consequences and no more than one of each kind. Each Consequence is a kind of Aspect and represents real damage: ``Shattered jaw'' or ``Hopelessly depressed'' or ``Hunted by loan sharks'' are all good. Each is free-taggable by your enemies once. Consequences are discussed in more detail in each combat chapter.
