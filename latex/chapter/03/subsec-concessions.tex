\subsection{Concessions}\label{sec:Concessions} % \href{sec:id81}

At any time in a fight of any kind, if you have not been Taken Out, you can offer a concession. Referees especially like this to keep villains alive for another day. A concession is something you offer to end the combat instead of play it through. If your opponent accepts it, it's true. Good concessions give something up but keep you in play. Things like, ``I tell him the combination to the safe but sneak out while he's not looking, escaping back to my safe house'' or ``Our ship escapes through the slipknot but our motors are not working so we're stranded on the other side'' are great.
