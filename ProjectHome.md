Diaspora is a hard sci-fi role-playing game based on the FATE engine. Its description, and links to buy it, are at the [VSCA website](http://www.vsca.ca/Diaspora/). This is the system resource document (SRD), the public and community-maintained version of the core rules. The content is based on the VSCA version of the SRD, at http://www.vsca.ca/Diaspora/diaspora-srd.html

This project aims to publish the SRD in various formats. The first version (and currently the only one available) is LaTeX. We would like to see the following:

**HTML** LaTeX
**Plain text**

(the above list will grow as we come up with more ideas)
